tensorflow-probability        0.7.0                  

It's better use the same version of tensorflow-gpu. 
Because I found the higher version sometimes failed with weird errors.

lucid is a very useful visualization library, you would like to install the newest version of it for more functions. 
But only the version supports tensorflow-gpu 1.x.
